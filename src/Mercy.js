            <p>Hi, I'm [Your Name], a student hooked on coding with JavaScript. I'm all about building web apps â€“ from dynamic interfaces to interactive features. Turning lines of code into cool web experiences is my thing. When I'm not coding, you'll find me solving puzzles and teaming up with others. Let's dive into the world of web tech together!</p>
